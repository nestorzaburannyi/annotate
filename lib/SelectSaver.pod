=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use SelectSaver;

    {
       my $saver = SelectSaver->new(FILEHANDLE);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A C<SelectSaver> object contains a reference to the file handle that
was selected when it was created.  If its C<new> method gets an extra
parameter, then that parameter is selected; otherwise, the selected
file handle remains unchanged.

When a C<SelectSaver> is destroyed, it re-selects the file handle
that was selected when it was created.
