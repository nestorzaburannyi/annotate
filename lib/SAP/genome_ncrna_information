ncRNA Information for Annotation in GenBank
This is a guide for how to annotate Rfam output and ncRNA features for GenBank submission. The basic annotation is described in the prokaryotic and eukaryotic annotation instructions. This list of ncRNAs and Rfam products is not exhaustive and may not be the most currently correct functional assessment of these, as functions become defined for some of these RNAs. Therefore, the purpose of this page is to provide guidance on how to annotate a particular RNA. The basic logic is:

Annotate ribosomal RNAs as rRNA features, and tRNAs as tRNA features.
Annotate RNAs that belong to one of the INSDC ncRNA_classes, http://www.insdc.org/rna_vocab.html , as an ncRNA with the appropriate value in the required /ncRNA_class qualifier.
Some Rfam records are regions of RNAs, so they should not be annotated as RNA features. Instead,
annotate riboswitches that bind known molecules and aren't ribozymes as regulatory features with /regulatory_class and /bound_moiety
annotate others that bind known molecules as misc_binding features with the bound molecule in the required field
annotate other regions, like leader sequences, as misc_features.

        FinP            RF00107

*Catalytic introns should be annotated as ncRNAs with ncRNA_class="autocatalytically_spliced_intron"
    Group I intron (RF00028) http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk/family?acc=RF00028
    Group II intron (RF00029) http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk/family?acc=RF00029

These should be annotated as ncRNA if they occur as introns in a gene or if they occur in
isolation. You would not need an intron feature if they interrupt a CDS. The CDS will have
the join and then there will also be an ncRNA feature.

*Bacteria don't have a nucleolus, but they have a class of small RNAs that are similar to snoRNAs.
Annotate these as ncRNA_class="snoRNA". eg:

     gene            42650..42727
                     /locus_tag="HMPREF9131_0857"
     ncRNA           42650..42727
                     /locus_tag="HMPREF9131_0857"
                     /ncRNA_class="snoRNA"
                     /product="putative Small nucleolar RNA SNORD19"
                     /inference="nucleotide motif:RFAM:RF00569"


* Annotate these as ncRNA with ncRNA_class="ribozyme"

    ribozyme    product pR1 ribozyme (EU267931)
        ribozyme        product glmS riboswitch (CP000922) Rfam RF00234 (this is defined as a ribozyme)



*Riboswitches should be annotated as 'regulatory' features when there is a known bound moiety and they
aren't defined as ribozymes. They must also include the mandatory attribute /regulatory_class="riboswitch",
and should include the /bound_moiety qualifier.

A TPP riboswitch might look like this in the GenBank flatfile view:

     regulatory       42650..42727
                     /regulatory_class="riboswitch"
                     /note="TPP riboswitch"
                     /bound_moiety=" thiamine/thiamin pyrophosphate"

 A few examples of such riboswitches are:

    FMN riboswitch (RFN element)      bound_moiety = flavin mononucleotide
    TPP riboswitch (THI element)      bound_moiety = thiamine/thiamin pyrophosphate
    Cobalamin riboswitch              bound_moiety = adenosylcobalamin
    gcvT element                      bound_moiety = glycine
    glycine riboswitch                bound_moiety = glycine
        purine riboswitch                 bound_moiety = guanine and/or adenine
        SAM riboswitch                    bound_moiety = S-adenosyl methionine
        preQ1 riboswitch                  bound_moiety = pre-queuosine1
        lysine riboswitch                 bound_moiety = lysine


*Riboswitches with unknown functions or bound moieties are annotated as misc_features with the name in
a note. A few examples are:

    yybP-ykoY element or yybP-ykoY leader
    ydaO/yuaA element
    ykoK element
    ykkC-yxkD element


*Annotate these as misc_feature because they are regions of a transcript

    S-element
    rncO                        RF00552
    serC                        RF00517
    ribosomal S15 leader
    speF                        RF00518
        Insertion sequence IS1222 ribosomal frameshifting element     RF00383
        alpha operon binding site   RF00140
        dnaX ribosomal frameshifting element                          RF00382

*T box leader can be annotated as a misc_binding feature with bound_moiety="uncharged tRNA"

*PyrR binding sites should be misc_binding feature with bound_moiety="PyrR"

*traJ 5' UTR RF00243 annotate as misc_binding with bound_moiety="FinP"
